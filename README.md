# Introduction

This repo contains an example app that can make use of the [fancy-react](https://github.com/eddiesholl/atom-fancy-react) Atom plugin. There are a couple of things you can try out here:

- Use the `generate` action to fill in implementations for the components used by `ClassBased.js`
- Use the `tests` action to generate tests for source files, for example generate tests for `ClassBased.js`
- Compile the generated code using the `webpack` config
- Run the generated tests using `jest`

# Commands

- `npm test` - runs jest
- `npm start` - runs webpack
